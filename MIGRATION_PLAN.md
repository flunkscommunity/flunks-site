# 🎪 The Magic Act: Flunks Site Migration Plan

## 🎯 Mission: Deploy to flunks.net with Access Control

You've got an **incredible** Flunks 95 site with all the bells and whistles:
- 🏠 Sophisticated clique access system for exclusive NFT holder content
- 🎮 Trial mode for wallet-free exploration  
- 📻 Radio stations, games, profile system, and more
- 🖥️ Full Windows 95 desktop experience

**The Magic:** Deploy this to `flunks.net` while keeping the current site's access restrictions.

## 🔐 Solution: Beta Access Gate

I've created a **professional access gate** that:

### ✨ What It Does:
- **Blocks unauthorized visitors** with a clean, themed access screen
- **Preserves ALL existing features** once access is granted
- **Bypasses automatically** in development (localhost)
- **Stores access in session** (persists until browser close)
- **Easy to manage** via environment variables

### 🎫 Access Codes Created:
```
FLUNKS2025     - Admin/Team access
SEMESTER0      - Beta tester access  
HIGHSCHOOL95   - Community access
```

### 🎨 User Experience:
1. **Visitor arrives** → Sees professional "Flunks High School - Access Required" screen
2. **Enters valid code** → Full site unlocks with all features
3. **Session persists** → No need to re-enter code during session
4. **Invalid code** → Helpful error with contact info

## 🚀 Deployment Methods

### **Option A: Vercel (Fastest & Easiest)** ⭐

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Deploy
cd /Users/jeremy/Desktop/flunks-site
vercel --prod

# 3. Add flunks.net domain in Vercel dashboard
# 4. Update DNS to point to Vercel
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Instant deploys with git pushes
- ✅ Automatic SSL certificates
- ✅ Environment variable management UI
- ✅ Preview deployments for testing
- ✅ Built-in analytics

### **Option B: Traditional Hosting**

```bash
# 1. Build the site
./deploy.sh

# 2. Upload .next folder to hosting
# 3. Configure environment variables
# 4. Update DNS
```

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Migration

### **Phase 1: Preparation** (5 minutes)
1. ✅ **Access gate implemented** (already done!)
2. ✅ **Environment variables configured** (ready!)
3. ✅ **Deployment scripts created** (ready!)

### **Phase 2: Testing** (10 minutes)
```bash
# Test locally with access gate
npm run build
npm start  # This will show access gate

# Test access codes
node scripts/check-access-codes.js --test SEMESTER0
```

### **Phase 3: Deployment** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Or use the deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

### **Phase 4: DNS & Domain** (24-48 hours for propagation)
1. **Add flunks.net** to your hosting provider
2. **Update DNS records** to point to new hosting
3. **Verify SSL certificate** is working

### **Phase 5: Go Live** (1 minute)
1. **Share access codes** with intended users
2. **Test end-to-end** user experience
3. **Monitor and adjust** as needed

## 🎮 Access Management Strategy

### **Launch Strategy:**
1. **Week 1:** Limited access with `FLUNKS2025` for core team
2. **Week 2:** Beta access with `SEMESTER0` for community  
3. **Week 3+:** Broader access with `HIGHSCHOOL95`
4. **Public Launch:** Remove access gate entirely

### **Removing Access Gate:**
When ready for full public access:
```bash
# Method 1: Environment variable
NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_REQUIRED="false"

# Method 2: Code removal (permanent)
# Remove AccessGate component from pages/index.tsx
```
