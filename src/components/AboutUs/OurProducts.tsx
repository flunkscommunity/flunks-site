        Flunk Originals is a collection of 10K unique pixel art characters. Each
        Flunk is composed of seven layers of traits: Backdrop, Face, Torso,
        Pigment, Superlative, Clique, and Head. With over 1 million possible
        combinations, every Flunk is one-of-a-kind and programmatically
        generated.

        Backpacks is a collection of 10K unique items discovered in the school's
        Lost and Found by each Flunk owner. Featuring forty base designs, each
        backpack has three traits with over 20 different pattern and color
        combinations.
        <br />

        Each Flunk can claim one backpack for free. This is a one-time process,
        no duplicates allowed!

      <span className="text-xl md:text-xl max-w-2xl text-pretty">
        Flunk Portraits are a re-imagining of the Flunk Originals. Each trait
        from the Originals collection has been meticulously redrawn in four
        variations to match the Clique (Geek, Freak, Jock, and Prep) of the
        Flunk.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each Flunk can undergo a Graduation Ceremony to update their artwork
        from Original to Portrait. This is a one-time process that cannot be
        reversed, but both versions are stored in the metadata, preserving both
        pieces of art.
