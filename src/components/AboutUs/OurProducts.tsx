        Flunk Portraits are a reimagination of the Flunk Originals. Each trait
        from the Originals collection has been meticulously redrawn in four
        variations to match the Clique (Geek, Freak, Jock, and Prep) of the
        Flunk.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each Flunk can undergo a Graduation Ceremony to update their artwork
        from Original to Portrait. This is a one-time process that cannot be
        reversed, but both versions are stored in the metadata, preserving both
        pieces of art.
